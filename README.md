Notes:
1) I worked with TA-james and classmate-matt to correct indent and infinite loop errors.
2) For #8 the line spacing code was copied from the previous section and authored by the "starting code's" author
3) For errors, i used AI to instruct me how to correct an error: examples of this include: 
    -is this line of code "_____" an example of list comprehention?
    -how do you fix this issue: "builtin_function_or_method' object is not subscriptable"
